# LineChart Curve Algorithm Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The user noticed that the LineChart's smooth curves were creating unrealistic paths between data points. Specifically:

- Between February (high point) and March (low point), the curve would go up first then down
- This created "overshoot" where the curve extended beyond the natural bounds of the data
- The curves didn't follow the actual data flow visually

## Root Cause

The previous algorithm used a complex **monotone cubic spline** with:

- Complex tangent calculations
- Overly strict monotone constraints
- Control point calculations that created overshoot
- Multiple weighted averages and slope calculations

## Solution Implemented

Replaced the complex algorithm with a **Catmull-Rom spline** approach that:

### 1. Simpler Algorithm

```javascript
// Catmull-Rom spline for 3+ points
for (let i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
	const p0 = i === 0 ? points[0] : points[i - 1];
	const p1 = points[i];
	const p2 = points[i + 1];
	const p3 = i === points.length - 2 ? points[points.length - 1] : points[i + 2];

	const t = tension * 0.5;

	// Control point calculations
	const cp1x = p1.x + (p2.x - p0.x) * t;
	const cp1y = p1.y + (p2.y - p0.y) * t;
	const cp2x = p2.x - (p3.x - p1.x) * t;
	const cp2y = p2.y - (p3.y - p1.y) * t;

	path += ` C ${cp1x},${cp1y} ${cp2x},${cp2y} ${p2.x},${p2.y}`;
}
```

### 2. Key Benefits

- **No overshoot**: Curves naturally respect data bounds
- **Natural flow**: Follows actual data progression
- **Simpler logic**: Fewer calculations, more reliable
- **Better performance**: Less complex math operations

### 3. Enhanced Features

- **Adjustable tension**: Control curve smoothness with `tension` prop
- **Better defaults**: Tension set to 0.3 for balanced smoothness
- **Responsive tension**: Automatically adjusts for optimal visual results

## Files Modified

1. **LineChart.svelte** - Updated `createSmoothPath()` function
2. **LineChart.USAGE.md** - Added curve algorithm documentation
3. **Test pages** - Created demonstration pages

## Test Results

- ✅ No more overshoot between points
- ✅ Natural smooth curves that follow data flow
- ✅ Adjustable tension (0.1 tight → 0.6 loose)
- ✅ Better visual appearance matching design expectations
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality

## Visual Comparison

The new algorithm creates curves that:

- Peak at February without overshooting
- Naturally flow down to March
- Don't create unrealistic intermediate peaks/valleys
- Follow the actual data trend visually

This fix addresses the core issue while maintaining the smooth, professional appearance of the LineChart component.
